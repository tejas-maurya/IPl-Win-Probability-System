# IPL-Win-Probability-System
The IPL Win Probability Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the real-time winning probability of an IPL cricket team during a live match. The system takes current match conditions such as score, overs, wickets, and target and calculates the chances of the batting and bowling teams winning the match.
